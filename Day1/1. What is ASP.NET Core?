What is ASP.NET Core?

ASP.NET Core is a fast, cross-platform, and open-source framework designed for building modern web applications. 
Whether you're creating a web app, API, or microservice, ASP.NET Core gives you the tools to build scalable solutions that run on Windows, macOS, or Linux. 
It’s especially suited for enterprise-grade projects that demand performance and reliability.

Full Stack Web Development:

ASP.NET Core supports full stack development by combining both front-end and back-end capabilities into one cohesive framework:
For front-end UI, it offers Blazor, a C#-based component model that supports both server-side and client-side (via WebAssembly) rendering.

Prefer working with JavaScript frameworks? 
ASP.NET Core easily integrates with popular libraries like Angular, React, or Vue, letting you choose your front-end tech stack.

Powerful API Development
Creating APIs is straightforward and efficient with ASP.NET Core:
Build RESTful APIs, gRPC services, or real-time features using SignalR.
With built-in OpenAPI (Swagger) support, documenting and testing APIs becomes seamless.
These APIs can power everything from web applications to mobile and desktop apps.

Flexible Modular Architecture
ASP.NET Core uses a modular design that promotes flexibility and maintainability:
Features like dependency injection, middleware, and centralized configuration are built in.
Middleware components let you tailor how requests and responses are handled—whether it’s routing, authentication, session handling, or serving static files.
The use of dependency injection makes it easier to write clean, testable code.

Built-In Security
Security is a top priority in ASP.NET Core:
Out-of-the-box support for authentication and authorization makes it easier to protect your apps.
These features help manage user identities and safeguard sensitive information.

Boosting Developer Productivity
Overall, ASP.NET Core empowers developers to build full stack web apps quickly and efficiently.
Its modern design, powerful features, and excellent tooling create a productive development environment that accelerates delivery without compromising quality.
