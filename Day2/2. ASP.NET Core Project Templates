üöÄ ASP.NET Core Project Templates
Starting a new web project can be overwhelming ‚Äî especially when it comes to setting up the necessary files, folders, and configurations. 
ASP.NET Core simplifies this process with predefined project templates that give developers a quick and structured starting point.

üì¶ What Are ASP.NET Core Project Templates?
ASP.NET Core project templates are preconfigured blueprints included in the .NET SDK. 
They allow you to generate new applications quickly with essential components already in place.

These templates help:
Standardize project structure.
Reduce setup time.
Ensure best practices are followed.
Offer optional features like authentication, logging, and OpenAPI documentation.

üõ†Ô∏è Viewing Available Templates
To view all the built-in templates that come with the .NET SDK, open a terminal or command prompt and run:
dotnet new list

This command lists all the available templates, including the short names used to create projects from the command line.

üìò Common ASP.NET Core Project Templates

Here are some of the most widely used ASP.NET Core templates:

Template	                    Short Name	                    Description
ASP.NET Core Empty	            web	                              A minimal project with no predefined structure ‚Äî ideal for building from scratch.
Blazor Web App	                blazor	                          A template for building rich, interactive UI apps using C# and Razor, with both server-side and client-side capabilities.
Web API	                        webapi	                          A RESTful API project with support for controllers or minimal APIs. OpenAPI and authentication can be included.
gRPC Service                  	grpc	                            A high-performance template for building gRPC-based services using ASP.NET Core.


üéõÔ∏è Customizing Templates
Each template supports various customization options so you can tailor the project to your specific needs. 

You can:
Enable authentication
Add Entity Framework Core support
Enable OpenAPI (Swagger)
Include caching, logging, or health checks

To view options for a specific template, use the --help flag:
dotnet new <template-name> --help

For example:
dotnet new webapi --help

‚öôÔ∏è Creating a Project with .NET CLI

To create a new project using a template, run:
dotnet new <template-name>

Example:
Create an empty web app project:
dotnet new web

Then build and run your app:
dotnet build
dotnet run

üñ•Ô∏è Using Visual Studio or VS Code
While the .NET CLI is powerful, you can also create, run, and debug ASP.NET Core projects using:
Visual Studio (Windows/macOS)
Visual Studio Code (with the C# Dev Kit extension)

These tools provide an intuitive graphical interface and integrated debugging support, making development even more efficient.
