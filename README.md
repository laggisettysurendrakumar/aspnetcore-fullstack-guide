**Introduction**

Developing modern web applications requires working with a wide range of technologies and ensuring seamless communication between the front-end and back-end. To tackle this complexity, developers need a powerful and flexible framework that simplifies the process while delivering high performance and scalability. ASP.NET Core, part of the .NET ecosystem, is built specifically for these needs, offering a rich set of tools for creating efficient, modern web applications.

In this module, you'll explore what ASP.NET Core is, understand its core architecture, and learn when it's the right choice for your projects.
